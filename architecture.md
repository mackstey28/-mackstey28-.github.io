I used to be an avid TF2 player. In fact, I played a lot of TF2 soldier jumping, and made a couple of jump maps and silly videos. 

You can check them all out <ins>[here!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGqHUMBhE00p00YMQ-W0l8A)</ins>
(I unlisted a lot of my videos though)

Here are all the TF2 maps I‚Äôve made to:

&emsp;[jump_ascent_final](https://tempus.xyz/maps/jump_ascent_final)<br/>
&emsp;[jump_descent_v5](https://tempus.xyz/maps/jump_descent_v5)<br/>
&emsp;[jump_damer_rc6](https://tempus.xyz/maps/jump_damer_rc6)<br/>
&emsp;[jump_ante](https://tempus.xyz/maps/jump_ante)<br/>

Here are all the TF2 maps I've collaborated in:

&emsp;[jump_academy_2_rc8](https://jumpacademy.tf/maps/academy2/rc8)<br/>
&emsp;[jump_corona_v2](https://tempus.xyz/maps/jump_corona_v2)<br/>
&emsp;[jump_chasm_final](https://tempus.xyz/maps/jump_chasm_final)<br/>

My favorite jump maps were jump_apex, jump_vex, jump_valley, and jump_sync.

I also liked sitood‚Äôs maps a lot.

However, despite the massive amount of hours I‚Äôve spent wasted on TF2, I realized that I was extremely passionate about architecture, specifically map making. I even wanted to major in it, but got rejected from the colleges üôÅ.

I loved using Hammer Editor (the map editing software used for Source games like TF2). I hope one day I can get back into mapping (but not gaming!) 

I especially love the brutalist architecture style. It is just so cool to me, and I want to make a map using brutalism. This will be a future goal of mine! I think I may implement it in Blender, but I first need to learn to use that damn software first.
