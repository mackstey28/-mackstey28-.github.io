I first got into computer science back in high school, when I programmed on those TI-84 calculators and wrote infinite loops on my friend’s calculators to annoy them. I was amazed at the concept of loops and was hooked ever since.

I’m majoring in computer science at RPI and I’m graduating in December 2022. Here are some of my links!

I’ve interned at Raytheon and Gore in the past. Currently am looking for a full time position.

I am experienced in full stack development, database systems, and automated testing/debugging.
