I first got into computer science back in high school, when I programmed on those TI-84 calculators and wrote infinite loops on my friend‚Äôs calculators to annoy them. I was amazed at the concept of loops and was hooked ever since.

I‚Äôm majoring in computer science at RPI and I‚Äôm graduating in December 2022. Here are some of my links!

I‚Äôve interned at Raytheon and W.L. Gore & Associates in the past. Currently am looking for a full time position, and it‚Äôs brutal out there üôÅ. Honestly, I care more about getting a decent paying job that doesn‚Äôt take too much time and leaves me plenty of time and money for my own hobbies, aspirations, and adventures.

I am experienced in full stack development, database systems, and automated testing/debugging.
