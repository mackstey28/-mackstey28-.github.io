I first got into computer science back in high school, when I programmed on those TI-84 calculators and wrote infinite loops on my friend’s calculators to annoy them. I was amazed at the concept of loops and was hooked ever since.

I’m majored in computer science at RPI and I graduated in December 2022. Attending RPI has been my biggest regret in life. Here are some of my links!

I am experienced in full stack development, database systems, and automated testing/debugging.

Here is my experience (past, present, and future):

- Pratt and Whitney, Summer 2021 internship

- W.L. Gore & Associates, Summer 2022 internship

- Cboe Global Markets, Jan to Jun 2023 co-op

- BNY Mellon, fulltime starting August 2023. (However, it is in Pittsburgh. I will try to transfer to NYC)
