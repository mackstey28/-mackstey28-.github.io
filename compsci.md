I first got into computer science back in high school, when I programmed on those TI-84 calculators and wrote infinite loops on my friend’s calculators to annoy them. I was amazed at the concept of loops and was hooked ever since.

I’m majoring in computer science at RPI and I’m graduating in December 2022. Here are some of my links!

I’ve interned at Raytheon and Gore in the past. 

I have an offer from Cboe for a co-op from January 2023 to August 2023.

I have a fulltime offer at BNY Mellon starting August 2023. However, it is in Pittsburgh, not NYC :( I will try to get it in NYC.

I am experienced in full stack development, database systems, and automated testing/debugging.
