Back in December 2021/January 2022, I wanted to quit gaming (TF2) in general, so I was trying to figure out a different way to spend my time. 

I decided to learn juggling for the hell of it, and because it was a pretty well known skill. I started juggling and was extremely frustrated at the start, but for some reason I decided to stick with it and now I am currently an intermediate juggler. Just a bit of a side hobby!

I can juggle 4 balls well and can do a lot of 3 ball tricks. I am currently learning 5 balls. I’ve gotten 7 catches with 5 as my personal most. It is hard as hell.

Once I get my 5 ball cascade down, I’ll learn to juggle clubs and rings.

Here are some videos of my juggling: (INSERT VIDEOS!)

## Current tricks I’m grinding:

3 balls
- Box
- BBB
- Mill’s Mess
- Left Backcross

4 balls
- Wimpy
- Shower
- 55550?

5 balls
- Cascade

My favorite juggling pattern is the shower and multiplexes.

My favorite jugglers are Michael Davis, Alex Barron, Thomas Dietz, and Jason Garfield.
