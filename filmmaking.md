Back when I played TF2, I made a lot of videos, and I used software such as Sony Vegas Pro, Adobe Premiere, and Adobe After Effects. I always enjoyed video editing, and in college I took two video editing classes.

They were my favorite classes and I had a blast making silly videos and making my classmates laugh.

In Spring 2022, I took a class called Video Art. You can watch some of the videos I made for it down below.

In Fall 2022, I took another video class called Digital Filmmaking. Here are some more videos I made for that class.

I definitely want to make a comedy (short?) film in the future! I have some ideas and Iâ€™m gonna work towards them. However, I am camera shy and will NOT star in them. Sorry!

I have this idea where I approach random people on the streets and ask them for video ideas, and make a short for that idea, whether it sucks or not! Shoutout to Colton for this idea.
