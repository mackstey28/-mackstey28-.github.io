## <ins>Background</ins>

I started bboying (breakdancing) when I was around 17 years old.

I had to write a paper on different styles of dance. One of the styles I wrote about was breakdancing, and I saw this video of the Guinness World Record for ‚ÄúMost Headspins in One Minute‚Äù, which you can view here:

I was amazed at the speed he goes, and from that moment I decided to learn to bboy.

I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm pretty decent at it now, although my toprock and footwork suck ASS.

I want to learn headspins so badly, it‚Äôs the only move I ever wanted. Unfortunately, this damn move is so impossible. Every practice, I still try to grind it to no avail üôÅ.

## <ins>Current Tricking Progress</ins>

I also started getting into tricking a bit.

In case you don‚Äôt know what tricking is, it is essentially the art of flips and kicks, including backflips. I always wanted to be able to do a backflip, and I tried to grind the backflip during summer 2022, but unfortunately going backwards over your head is just too scary. 

I even ate shit a couple times doing backflips. I decided I will work on other skills until I can get back to the backflip. 

Here is the one day where I could do backflips:
